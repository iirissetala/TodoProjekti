# TodoProject
This is a small fullstack project done in the middle of a 12 week intensive Java course (Summer 2019) by Academy (part of Academic Work).
This was my first fullstack project and it is executed with PostgreSQL database, Springboot and jdbc in backend, 
and HTML, CSS and Javascript in frontend.

This is a simple todo-list where you can GET all your tasks, POST tasks and DELETE tasks.
