# TodoProject
This is a small fullstack project done in the middle of a 12 week intensive Java course (Summer 2019) by Academy (part of Academic Work).
This was my first fullstack project and it is executed with PostgreSQL database, Springboot and jdbc in backend, 
and HTML, CSS and Javascript in frontend.

This is a simple todo-list where you can list (GET), add (POST) and remove (DELETE) tasks.

October 2019: I came back to this project for some reason and noticed that I had not succeeded with modifying existing tasks (PUT), so i added that possibility. No other changes were made.
